```javascript
{
  uid: "user123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "student|teacher|admin",
  profile: {
    name: "John Doe",
    phone: "+1234567890",
    department: "Computer Science",
    // Role-specific fields
  },
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  isActive: true
}
```

#### 4.1.2 Appointments Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "apt123",
  studentId: "student123",
  teacherId: "teacher456",
  subject: "Mathematics",
  date: "2024-01-15",
  time: "10:00",
  duration: 60,
  status: "pending|confirmed|cancelled|completed",
  notes: "Student notes",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

#### 4.1.3 Messages Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "msg123",
  conversationId: "conv123",
  senderId: "user123",
  receiverId: "user456",
  content: "Message content",
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  read: false,
  type: "text|file|appointment_request"
}
```

### 4.2 Data Relationships
- Users have many appointments (as student or teacher)
- Appointments belong to one student and one teacher
- Messages belong to conversations between users
- Logs track all system activities

### 4.3 Indexing Strategy
```javascript
// firestore.indexes.json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "appointments",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "studentId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "date", "order": "ASCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "messages",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "conversationId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
